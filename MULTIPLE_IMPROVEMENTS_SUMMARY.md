# Multiple Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes multiple improvements made to the RFP Excel generation, BOM Excel generation, file management, and site survey details page.

## 1. ✅ RFP Excel Improvements

### Changes Made
**File:** `/app/api/site-surveys/[id]/generate-rfp/route.ts`

#### Combined Products & Services Tab
- **Before**: Separate tabs for products and services
- **After**: Single "PRODUCTS & SERVICES" tab with all items combined

#### Column Structure
| # | Type | Name | Brand | Category | Qty | Unit Price (€) | Margin (%) | Subtotal (€) | Total (€) |
|---|------|------|-------|----------|-----|----------------|------------|--------------|-----------|

#### Key Features
1. **Brand Name Extraction**: 
   - Extracts brand name from object: `typeof item.brand === 'object' ? item.brand?.name : item.brand`
   - Same for category name

2. **Excel Formulas**:
   - Subtotal: `=F3*G3` (Quantity × Unit Price)
   - Total: `=I3+(I3*H3/100)` (Subtotal + (Subtotal × Margin%))
   - Grand Total: `=SUM(I3:I[lastRow])` and `=SUM(J3:J[lastRow])`

3. **Header Row Styling**:
   - Background color applied only to header cells (not entire row)
   - Dark blue (`#1F4E78`) background with white text
   - All header cells styled using `eachCell()` method

4. **Total Row Styling**:
   - Background color applied only to cells H, I, J (label and values)
   - Yellow (`#FFD966`) background for visibility
   - Not applied across entire row width

#### Column Structure
| # | Product Name | Code | Category | Manufacturer Code | EAN Code | Quantity |
|---|--------------|------|----------|-------------------|----------|----------|

#### Key Features
1. **Product Details**:
   - Product Code: `product.code || product.erpCode || '-'`
   - Category Name: Extracted from object if needed
   - Manufacturer Code: `product.manufacturerCode || '-'`
   - EAN Code: `product.eanCode || '-'`
   - Quantity: Aggregated per product

2. **Total Row**:

   - Styled with background color
   - Proper borders applied

3. **Removed Unused Columns**:

   - Shows progress: "DELETING..." during operation
   - Success toast: "Successfully deleted X file(s)"
   - Error handling for failed deletions

4. **State Management**:

   - `handleBulkDelete()`: Execute bulk deletion

#### UI Layout
