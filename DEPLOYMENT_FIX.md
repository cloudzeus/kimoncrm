# Deployment Fix - TypeScript Error Resolved

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed

### Error That Was Blocking Deployment:

```
Type error: Property 'isTypical' does not exist on type 'Floor'.

  1027 |       building.floors.forEach((floor) => {
  1028 |         // Calculate floor multiplier for typical floors
> 1029 |         const floorMultiplier = floor.isTypical && floor.repeatCount ? floor.repeatCount : 1;
       |                                       ^
  1030 |         totalFloors += floorMultiplier;
```

**File:** `components/site-surveys/cabling-hierarchy-form.tsx`

### Root Cause:
The `Floor` interface was missing the `isTypical` and `repeatCount` properties that were being used in the code.

### Fix Applied:
Added the missing properties to the Floor interface:

```typescript
interface Floor {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  level?: number;
  blueprintUrl?: string;
  similarToFloorId?: string;
  notes?: string;
  floorRacks?: FloorRack[];
  rooms: Room[];
  expanded?: boolean;
  images?: string[];
  isTypical?: boolean;      // ‚úÖ ADDED
  repeatCount?: number;     // ‚úÖ ADDED
}
```

## ‚úÖ Status

- **TypeScript Build Error:** FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Linter Errors:** NONE ‚úÖ  
- **Image Search Feature:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ
- **Ready for Deployment:** YES ‚úÖ

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables Required:

```env
# Google Image Search API (for Product Image Search feature)
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=AIzaSyDrWSRds2EalBKx2nOpK9_hBRW3aAYC5rg
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=d5b1ea337fb744a49
```

### Dependencies Installed:
- ‚úÖ `sharp` - for image processing and WebP conversion

### Files Modified/Created:
1. ‚úÖ `app/actions/image-search.ts` - Server actions (Google + Bing support)
2. ‚úÖ `components/products/product-image-search-dialog.tsx` - Client UI
3. ‚úÖ `components/products/products-manager.tsx` - Added "SEARCH IMAGES" menu
4. ‚úÖ `components/site-surveys/cabling-hierarchy-form.tsx` - **FIXED TypeScript error**
5. ‚úÖ `.env` - Added Google API credentials
6. ‚úÖ `.env.example` - Updated with image search variables

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Verify environment variables are set** (especially for production):
   ```env
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_key
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_id
   ```

2. **Build should now succeed:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to your platform** (Railway, Vercel, etc.)

## üêõ Other Warnings (Non-Blocking)

The build shows ESLint warnings but these are **not blocking deployment**:
- Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks (common pattern, safe to ignore)
- Suggestions to use Next.js `<Image />` instead of `<img>` tags (performance optimization, not critical)

These warnings don't prevent deployment and can be addressed incrementally.

## ‚ú® New Features Ready

Once deployed, users can:
1. Go to Products page
2. Click ‚ãÆ menu on any product
3. Select "SEARCH IMAGES"
4. Search up to 100 images from Google
5. Select images with checkboxes
6. Mark one as default image ‚≠ê
7. Upload - auto-converts to WebP, resizes, uploads to BunnyCDN
8. Images saved to database and visible immediately

## üìä Image Search Feature Summary

**Provider:** Google Custom Search API (with Bing fallback)
**Free Tier:** 100 searches/day (3,000/month)
**Processing:** 100% server-side (no CORS issues)
**Format:** Automatic WebP conversion
**Size:** Resized to 1200x1200px max
