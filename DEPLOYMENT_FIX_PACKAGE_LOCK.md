# Critical Fix: package-lock.json Excluded from Docker Build

## Issue

Build failed with npm 404 error:
```
npm error 404  '@radix-ui/react-focus-guards@1.1.3' is not in this registry.
```

## Root Cause

The `.dockerignore` file I created included `package-lock.json`, which prevented it from being copied into the Docker build context.

**Result:**
1. `npm ci` failed (requires package-lock.json)
2. Fell back to `npm install` 
3. `npm install` tried to resolve the latest versions
4. Hit 404 errors for packages that don't have those specific versions

## Fix

Removed `package-lock.json` from `.dockerignore`.

**Before:**
```dockerignore
# Dependencies
node_modules
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
package-lock.json  ❌ WRONG - needed for npm ci
yarn.lock
```

**After:**
```dockerignore
# Dependencies
node_modules
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
yarn.lock  ✅ Only exclude yarn.lock (using npm)
```

## Why This Matters

- `npm ci` is faster and more reliable than `npm install`
- It uses exact versions from package-lock.json
- Prevents version resolution issues
- Ensures consistent installs across environments

## Deploy Now

```bash
git add .dockerignore
git commit -m "Fix: Include package-lock.json in Docker build context"
git push origin master
```

This will fix the npm install errors and the build should succeed!

**Status:** Critical fix ready ✅  
**Impact:** Resolves npm 404 errors during build  
**Expected:** Build will now succeed using npm ci
