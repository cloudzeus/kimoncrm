## 📊 Data Flow

```
1. User opens wizard → Load existing data from API
                    ↓
2. Step 1: Infrastructure → Edit buildings/racks/rooms → Auto-save
                    ↓
3. Step 2: Equipment → Select products/services → Auto-save
                    ↓
4. Step 3: Pricing → Edit prices/quantities/margins
                    ↓
5. Final Submit → Save to database
                → Generate BOM Excel
                → Generate Word Document
                → Redirect to details page
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### For End Users
1. Navigate to a site survey
2. Click to open the wizard (you'll need to add a button/link)
3. Complete Step 1: Define your infrastructure
4. Move to Step 2: Select equipment
5. Review and adjust pricing in Step 3
6. Click "Generate BOM & Document" to complete

### For Developers

#### Add Wizard Link to Site Survey Page
```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

// In your component
<Button onClick={() => router.push(`/site-surveys/${siteSurveyId}/wizard`)}>
  Start Wizard
</Button>
```

#### Direct Integration
```tsx
import { SiteSurveyWizard } from "@/components/site-surveys/site-survey-wizard";

<SiteSurveyWizard
  siteSurveyId={id}
  siteSurveyData={siteSurvey}
  onComplete={() => console.log("Wizard completed!")}
/>
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar shows completion percentage
- **Step Indicators**: Color-coded badges show current/completed/pending steps
- **Collapsible Sections**: Buildings and floors can be expanded/collapsed
- **Real-time Updates**: All calculations update instantly
- **Validation**: Inline validation with helpful error messages
- **Responsive Tables**: Equipment tables work on all screen sizes
- **Summary Cards**: Quick overview of totals and statistics

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React useState for local state
- Automatic parent updates on changes
- Data flows from wizard → steps → wizard

### Data Persistence
- Auto-save on step navigation
- Manual save option available
- API calls to dedicated endpoints
- JSON storage in database

### Calculations
```typescript
// Item total with margin
const basePrice = price * quantity;
const marginAmount = basePrice * (margin / 100);
const totalPrice = basePrice + marginAmount;
```

### TypeScript Types
- Full type safety with TypeScript
- Reused existing types from `equipment-selection.ts`
- Type inference for better DX

## 📝 Testing Recommendations

1. **Step Navigation**: Test moving forward and backward through steps
2. **Data Persistence**: Refresh page and verify data is saved
3. **Calculations**: Test margin and pricing calculations
4. **Equipment Selection**: Add various products and services
5. **Infrastructure**: Test all CRUD operations
6. **Document Generation**: Verify Excel and Word output
7. **Edge Cases**: Empty data, zero quantities, negative prices

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Buildings data structure may need adjustment based on existing schema
2. Equipment associations with infrastructure are optional
3. No undo/redo functionality yet
4. Bulk operations not supported

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Equipment templates for common setups
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Price history and recommendations
- Equipment availability checking
- Multi-user collaboration
- Version history
- Comments and approvals workflow

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are responding
3. Check Prisma schema is up to date
4. Review the detailed guide in `SITE_SURVEY_WIZARD_GUIDE.md`
